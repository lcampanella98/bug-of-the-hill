# Bug of the Hill

Massively Online Multiplayer Game built in Node.js

Unless you're a biologist, you probably rarely think about the world of insects fighting for survival. 
Experience the struggle of an Ant, Spider, or Bee. Use your special attack to vie for center control and then defend your position. But don't get eaten by a Flytrap, they're everywhere.
