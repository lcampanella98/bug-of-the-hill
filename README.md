### Description

Unless you're a biologist, you probably rarely think about the world of insects fighting for survival. 
Experience the struggle and the conquest of an Ant, Spider, or Bee. Use your special attack to vie for center control and then defend your position. But don't get eaten by a Venus Flytrap, they're everywhere.
